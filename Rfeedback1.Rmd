## R makes the latest, best-documented high-level analytics tasks simple. *Unfortunately, it also makes simple tasks difficult.*

Why? It has questionable defaults and hidden contexts. Parts of it *evolved* instead of being *designed*.  

We will talk about our personal (opinionated!) practices for using R.  
These are largely derived from personal experience answering R questions for marketing and reporting groups.  
    
<br>  


###Expectations: 

#### You will know **some** of these practices.

#### You should NOT know **all** of these practices.

#### You will actively share your thoughts on the topic/practice/experience!

<br>  

#### You will know workarounds to make your R experience capable and frustration-free.

## Outline
### R is not quite ready when you get it.  

- "R is so mathy that it is hard to interact with"  
- General startups: stringsAsFactors and scipen  
- Source in or set as Rprofile 

### R makes some simple things more complicated than they should be.

- "I can't copy and paste my output!"
- "I want to output to Excel" (openxlsx)
- "Dates don't work"  
- "R isn't performing the function correctly"  
  
### R is tuned for compatiblity over speed. Fix this!  
- For loops are usually fine.  
- You can get over the RAM issues.  
- Use a faster version of R. It's SIMPLE.  

### "I gave up on R because it made me angry"
- "R isn't performing the function correctly!"  
- Rstudio has fixed most of your problems recently  
  
  
# How R is a bit broken when you install it
![Sometimes you need to help yourself.](C:/Users/NeilD/Google Drive/R/Presentation/Apr2019_DefrustratingR/Trabant.JPG)  

## A preface:
For Windows non-admin installations, install to "C:\something" or you are entering a world of pain.


## "R is so mathy that it is hard to interact with": stringsAsFactors 

If you create an R dataframe, it will assume that your string entry is a factor.

"#> invalid factor level, NA generated"

```{r options1, echo = TRUE}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

## "R is so mathy that it is hard to interact with": scientific notation penalty 
All numeric output comes as scientific notation.

##### It's running the default, which limits you to 5 digits. 
```{r options3, echo = TRUE}
options(scipen = NULL) 
print((100000))
```
```{r options4, echo = TRUE}
options(scipen = 999)
print((100000))
```

## What you want as your startup file  

These are worthy of:  

- 1. being in your .RProfile or 
- 2. In an sourced-in script that you cite before all of your programs or
- 3. just throw them at the top of your scripts

```{r options, echo = TRUE}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
options(scipen = 999)

```
### What's a .RProfile?   
  
Your .Rprofile is an  R script that runs each time R runs and they can be found within R_HOME, HOME and the project's home directory.  
Find them with getwd().  
  
### How to source-in a file?
This example is what I evolved into in a typical office environment.

source("S:/jsmith/loadlibraries.R") # housed on shared network drive -- holds all library()s and options

source("U:/jsmith/loadfunctions.R") # housed in personal folder to keep obscured from network

source("U:/jsmith/sqlconnectscript.R") # housed in personal folder to keep obscured from network


## R makes some simple things really hard.
![Simple things need to work, even if there are reasons they need workarounds.](C:/Users/NeilD/Google Drive/R/Presentation/Apr2019_DefrustratingR/BrakeLights.JPG)  

## "I can't copy and paste my output!" (1)  
You see what you want to copy from the output window, but you copy without retaining columns.  
```{r echo = TRUE}  
df <- data.frame(1:5, c(2,3,2,4,6), c(2,3,1,9,6), c(2,3,2,4,9), c(2,3,2,4,7), c(2,3,2,4,8))  
cor(df)  
```  

Option 1: Don't copy and paste, just output into CSV/TSV/xlsx  
If **not** huge, use tidyverse: write_tsv or write_csv  
If **huge**, use data.table::fwrite

Option 2: R2HTML  
```{r cp1, echo = TRUE}  
df <- data.frame(1:5, c(2,3,2,4,6), c(2,3,1,9,6), c(2,3,2,4,9), c(2,3,2,4,7), c(2,3,2,4,8))  
library(R2HTML)  
HTMLStart(outdir="c:/tmprdata/", file="myreport1", extension="html",  
          echo=FALSE, HTMLframe=TRUE)  
cor(df)  
HTMLStop()  
```  
file:///C:/tmprdata/myreport1.html</h6>


## "Forget all that complicated stuff, this report needs to read/write from Excel"  
Most-Googled packages: *xlsReadWrite, xlsx, writexl, XLConnect, Readxl* are options but use:  

openxlsx does it all: read/ write, uses tabs. Can even apply excel styles (e.g., commas,  dollars, percentages)

Imagine 3 output tables to go into a report.  
# To write out onto separate sheets  
      wb <- createWorkbook()  
  ## Add 3 worksheets  
      addWorksheet(wb, "cust")  
      addWorksheet(wb, "rev")  
      addWorksheet(wb, "skuqty")  
  ## Need data on worksheet to see all headers and footers  
      writeData(wb, sheet = 1, cust)  
      writeData(wb, sheet = 2, rev)  
      writeData(wb, sheet = 3, skuqty)  
## Save workbook  
saveWorkbook(wb, paste0("c:/temprdata/writeout1.xlsx"), overwrite = TRUE)  


Aside: Reading in dates rom Excel? Excel dates are the number of days since Dec 30, 1899.  
Get to a real date in R using this: as.Date(42705, origin = "1899-12-30")  

##R and speed
![It really can go fast, you may just have to change a few things.](C:/Users/NeilD/Google Drive/R/Presentation/Apr2019_DefrustratingR/AudiTrabant.JPG)  


### "Can I really use a for loop?"  
What are you doing? The answer is usually YES, unless you are doing some enormous artificial staged tasks.  
R has a bad habit of doing structural checks on its data. It will evaluate a column each time you change its structure. This can be pretty slow for certain (usually contrived) situations.  
- Create a full object structure (i.e., a blank dataframe) then update it rather than appending to it.  

### "I run out of RAM using R"
tidyverse functions don't modify in place, they copy and then (once verified as good) delete the old. This takes 2x the space! 
- Use a totally different package, like data.table, that is built for speed and modifies in place.


### "Are there better versions of R?" (yes, there are)
Vanilla R is the slowest R. It assumes your CPU has no math coprocessing. Matrix manipulations cannot get slower.  
a - Speed up your processing. Try Microsoft R Open for BLAS (basic linear algebra subprograms) + Intel math kernel libraries. Other BLAS packs (OpenBLAS for general CPUs, NVBLAS for NVidia GPUs) are available too.  

b - Speed up your data structures. data.table has a lot of efficiency tweaks.  

c - Speed up your data IO. Big data solutions that abstract from/with R: Spark, RevolutionR/ScaleR/MRS/AzureR/Rocker/H2O. 

d - all of the above. Use MRO with data.table. Data IO is constantly changing, but can be significant. 

e - "future" package (in development now) for de-serializing programs (or doParallel or foreach).  


## One last section...."I gave up on R because it made me angry"  
![Don't hit it with an ax yet. Things are already better.](C:/Users/NeilD/Google Drive/R/Presentation/Apr2019_DefrustratingR/TrabantDestruction.JPG)  
  
### "R isn't performing the function correctly!" "It ran yesterday."  

####Be explicit about which library's function you want!  
Do this: **data1 %>% dplyr::select(col1)**  
Not this: **data1 %>% select(col1)**  

Code breaks when two loaded packages share a function name.  
  
6,601 results for functions named "select"  
https://www.rdocumentation.org/search?q=select&latest=1  


### R has improved since 2016!  
Rstudio V1.x  
- Accidentally printing a huge output will no longer crash/cause issues  
- No longer freezes  
- Lots of added features (environment windows, connections  

tidyverse (now one library) has taken over.  
Forget about the first package suggested by Google. Get the first package suggested by rstudio. It will likely be tidyverse.  

Lots of improvements to applying functions to data at scale  
apply functions are still neato, but you can iterate and use lists better than ever (purrr, broom, etc)  
  
New and useful for time series data:  tsibble  

  
## dRive in style!!! Be capable, fast, and frustration-free!
